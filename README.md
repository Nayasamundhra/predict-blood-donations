# ü©∏ Predict Blood Donations

A data science case study focused on predicting whether a person will donate blood again based on historical donation patterns. The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze the **UCI Blood Transfusion Service Center dataset** and build classification models.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a blood donor will donate again in March 2007.
- **Dataset:** Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set.
- **Approach:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature transformation, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, TPOT AutoML), and evaluation using AUC score and confusion matrix.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TPOT (AutoML)
- Matplotlib (optional for plots)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

## üöÄ Features & Highlights

- Preprocessing including log normalization of skewed features.
- Train-test split with stratified sampling.
- Variance analysis to assess the need for feature scaling.
- Logistic Regression with AUC evaluation.
- AutoML pipeline using TPOT for optimal model selection.
- Manual comparison of models (Random Forest vs Logistic Regression).
- Feature importance analysis using Random Forest.

## üß™ Model Evaluation

- Metrics used: **AUC Score**, **Classification Report**, **Confusion Matrix**, **Feature Importance**
